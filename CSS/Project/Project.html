      <ul>
        <li>
          A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, or
          graphical program elements in the case of visual programming
          languages, to various kinds of machine code output.

          A programming language is any set of rules that converts strings, or
          graphical program elements in the case of visual programming
          languages, to various kinds of machine code output.[citation needed]
          Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used
          in computer programming to implement algorithms

          Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.
          There are programmable machines that use a set of specific
          instructions, rather than general programming languages. Prior to the
          invention of computers, programs were used to direct the behavior of
          machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos
        </li>

        <li>
          Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and
          more are being created every year. Many programming languages are
          written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to
          perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the
          desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).
        </li>
        <li>
          Programming language theory is a subfield of computer science that
          deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and
          classification of programming languages
