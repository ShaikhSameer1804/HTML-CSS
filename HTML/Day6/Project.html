        Developers mostly use Java for web apps' back-end interfaces or general
        service application programming interfaces (APIs) enhanced by frameworks
        such as Spring and Dropwizard. Java differs from JavaScript in that it's
        a strongly typed language, translating to a deeper learning curve. The
        complexity is an advantage that makes Java have higher performance. Java
        enforces its performance by multi-thread work that can run concurrently.
        JavaScript only uses a single thread. Java also balances complexity and
        performance by avoiding many items that the coder can manage in other
        languages. </span

        C is a low-level language. This means that it requires the programmer to
        understand the underlying computer hardware. High-level languages have
        abstracted the computer details. For example, when using a low-level
        language, your program can take care of memory management in the code.
        Typically, higher programming languages automate the process of memory
        management for computers. Although C is low level, it compensates for
        having better performance than other easy-to-learn languages. While
        performance might not be a significant concern for a social media app,
        it's a substantial consideration for gaming apps, movie special effects
        software, and portions of operating systems. </span

        This course is the first in a 2-course series, and it will prepare you
        for the JSE – Certified Entry-Level JavaScript Programmer certification
        exam. The main goal of the course is to guide you from a state of
        complete programming illiteracy to a level of programming knowledge
        which allows you to design, write, debug, and run programs encoded in
        the JavaScript language, and to understand the basic concepts of
        software development technology. </span

        React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Facebook and an
        open-source developer community run it. Although React is a library
        rather than a language, it is widely used in web development. The
        library first appeared in May 2013 and is now one of the most commonly
        used frontend libraries for web development. React offers various
        extensions for entire application architectural support, such as Flux
        and React Native, beyond mere UI. </span

        Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to query data. Computers send
        the SQL data queries to a server that responds with the requested data.
        SQL allows you to retrieve, insert, update, delete, and create data
        within a database. There are many variants of SQL and all variants have
        several similarities. The ANSI standard requirement enforces these
        similarities that the variants include significant commands, such as
        where, select, and delete. SQL database servers are useful in websites
        and apps in storing information such as a user's posts and profiles. SQL
        jobs and career opportunities include high-paying jobs in business
        intelligence and data science.

        Python is the programming language that opens more doors than any other,
        and the more you understand Python, the more you can do in the 21st
        Century. With a solid knowledge of Python, you can work in a multitude
        of jobs and a multitude of industries. Software Engineer, Software
        Developer, Machine Learning Engineer, AI Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Full
        Stack Developer, Data Scientist, Project Manager, Systems Administrator,
        Security Engineer, Tester... The jobs that involve Python are varied and
        interesting. And there are many of them. The choices you make every day
        shape your reality and determine who you are, but your life-changing
        decisions determine who you become. Here at OpenEDG, we believe in the
        value of education and certification, and in the power of life-changing
